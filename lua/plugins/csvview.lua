      --- The delimiter character
      --- You can specify a string, a table of delimiter characters for each file type, or a function that returns a delimiter character.
      --- Currently, only fixed-length strings are supported. Regular expressions such as \s+ are not supported.
      --- e.g:
      ---  delimiter = ","
      ---  delimiter = function(bufnr) return "," end

      --- The quote character
      --- If a field is enclosed in this character, it is treated as a single field and the delimiter in it will be ignored.
      --- e.g:

      --- You can also specify it on the command line.

      --- The comment prefix characters
      --- If the line starts with one of these characters, it is treated as a comment.
      --- Comment lines are not displayed in tabular format.
      --- You can also specify it on the command line.
